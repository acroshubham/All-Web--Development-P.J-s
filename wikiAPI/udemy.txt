client => server => database

so so so 
in designing the api what we are doing is that we are first seeing the methods of the apis which are crud oprations of we can say read write delete and put or patcchwhat wer are seeing is the tablw which looks like this

read /articles /aritcles-bauer
the first parameter is what we call api unctins and the second one is routing the routing and the spcified routing 
fo first of all we have to find the first routing that e have to display all the articles what we will do for it 
we will use the fid document function of the mongoose or mongo db

RESTful

HTTPS verbs          /articles            /articles/shubham-sharma   

GET          fetches all the articles    all article of shubham sharma

POST         create one new article                 -

PUT                 -                   updates all articles of shubham

PATCH               -                   updates article on shubham

DELETE        delete all the articles   delete article on sharma


post is challanging as client send data as we don't have any html prely defined or some post request prely defined.
without html how can we add the data.

client makes request from browser to server for some files 
and than server sends the files like html css and js to the browser
but sometimes browser needs the data for it

we can make such a get request to an api by simply (the above request above above post is chal... ) typing /articles enter and it'll send back data ti is server in json format how to do it in post method post man will help for it.

further what w have done is that one has to now open postman and trheir one can find the post method and we will post to localhost the url endcoded data from selecting body the titile and content as the key and the name and description as the value for those keys
and than we will console log those values 

afterwards we will console log those valuse 
and when we see that we get the value now we will save taht data in mongoose

and by writing tha code const newArticle = new Article ({
    title:
    content:
})

and making a send request from postman my data gets saved on robo


docs docs docs ***
can make you an expert

now postman is just loading and nothing happens 
why we have to make a function tha logs the erro or successful message 

how anjela knows it docs docs docs and docs ***

app.route helps to create chained route handlers 
docs of express

now what we have done we used the parameter 
that params one and used find one method.
